# SilentAuction
 Application to allow a group of people to perform a silent auction

## Plans
Currently the program runs in the console, but in the future I will come back to this and add a
GUI that will interface with the code currently completed. 

## Requirements
<ol>
    <li>Receive user name.</li>
    <li>Ask user for their bid.</li>
    <li>Store user_name + user_bid</li>
    <li>Receive input if additional bids are required.</li>
    <li>Clear users bid prior to receiving next users name.</li>
</ol>
